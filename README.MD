# 🚀 CosmiFi

CosmiFi is a decentralized platform for creating, sharing, and evolving space mission designs together.
It’s where engineers, designers, researchers, and dreamers collaborate to build humanity’s next steps beyond Earth.


## Blueprint NFT

At the heart of CosmiFi is the Blueprint NFT — a composable digital asset that represents a design or component, from a full spacecraft to a single PCB.

Each Blueprint NFT carries its data, authorship, and links to other designs it builds upon — forming an interconnected web of innovation.

When someone creates a new design that uses existing Blueprints, value and credit flow automatically across contributors through smart contracts.
This means designs are not just shared — they become living, evolving entities that grow as the community builds on them.

CosmiFi turns engineering creativity into a transparent, collaborative economy, where designs are verifiable, interoperable, and open to everyone.

A new kind of space race — not of nations, but of minds.

## 🌐 Core Concepts

Blueprint NFT — a composable NFT that encapsulates a design, its metadata, and dependencies.

Collaborative Design Exchange — share, remix, and build on others’ work while preserving attribution and value flow.

Decentralized Ownership — designs exist on-chain, enabling fractional ownership, trade, and transparent contribution tracking.

Open Space Innovation — bridging open hardware, digital collaboration, and blockchain to democratize mission design.
